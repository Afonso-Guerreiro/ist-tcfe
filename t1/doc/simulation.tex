\section{Simulation Analysis}

\label{sec:simulation}
We ran a simulation of the circuit using {\it Ngspice} thus obtaining the following results,

  \caption{\scriptsize Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}
Table ~\ref{tab:op} presents the voltage mesured at eight nodes, while there are only seven non-0V in the circuit. This is a result of {\it Ngspice} requiring a voltage source in order to mesure the voltage for a voltage dependent source, as $I_b$. Naturally, this extra voltage source was set to zero volts, hence acting only as shunt. As one can see the voltage between v(7) and v(8) are the same, this was where the extra source was connected. 
The voltage at the nodes matches the nodal analysis, and the currents match the mesh analysis, (given the approximations done by {\it Ngspice} of its output) as expected.
