\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a stationary circuit consisting of resistors, dependent and independent sources was achieved. Nodal and mesh analysis have been performed
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and circuit simulation was performed using the {\it Ngspice} tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results. The reason for this match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ. For more complex components, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this
work.
