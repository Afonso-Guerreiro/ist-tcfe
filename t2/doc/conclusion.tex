\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

With this paper, we were able to see how the capacitor behaves when a constant voltage is supplied ans well as time varying, in the matter at hand, a sinusoidal signal. As we stated before the theoretical predictions made, were in close agreement with the simulation results obtained. Any differences obtained may be attributed to numerical errors or approximations committed while carrying out the maths, since this deviations were never greater than $1\%$ of the results obtained analytically. 
As stated before, the operating point analysis supported the results attained using nodal analysis. The simulated natural response closely resembled the exponential solution derived from first principles, and so did the general solution as we saw from the resemblance of both graphs. At last, the transfer function derived in the last section, was a close match to the plot obtained from \textit{ngspice}, allowing us to verify that high frequencies tend to have significantly lower voltage magnitudes than lower frequencies at the terminals of the capacitor, thus as said before the system behaves as low pass filter.
